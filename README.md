MathCortex is a simple lightweight programming language that is designed for doing numerical calculation on web browsers. 


Start using [Mathcortex](http://mathcortex.com/). No installation or setup required.

###Main features are:
- Easy matrix manipulation and built-in matrix operations
- Sophisticated numerical computations like singular value decomposition(svd) and finding eigenvalues/vectors(eig)
- Implicit declarations
- Syntax similar to C and JavaScript
- Static typing, with full type inference
- Online integrated web environment
- Open source 

All the operations are done on browser for fast and server independent computing. The code is first compiled to a simple JavaScript intermediate code. The generated JavaScript code is evaluated and runs very fast on the browser.

Language is still being developed.
